# ALD/E Image Annotation – Question Types, Answer Types, and Examples

This document defines the four question types for **Materials Science (ALD/E images)**, adapted from prior QA designs in other domains.  
Each type is illustrated with examples tailored to the figures in this project.  
Questions can be answered in **yes/no, factoid, list, or paragraph** format. At least one **paragraph-style answer** (3+ sentences) should be provided per figure.

## 1. Process-Oriented Questions
**Purpose:** Test understanding of ALD/E cycles, precursor chemistry, and reaction mechanisms.  
**Typical Figures:** Process schematics, reaction diagrams, FRET energy transfer schemes.  

**Examples:**
- Q: *What are the four main steps of the ALD/MLD cycle shown in this schematic, and why is purging essential?* [figure 2](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_2.jpg)

  A (list/paragraph): Steps: (1) Precursor pulse, (2) Purge, (3) Co-reactant pulse, (4) Purge. Purging removes unreacted precursors and gaseous byproducts from the chamber. This step is essential because it prevents unwanted chemical reactions, ensuring the self-limiting nature of ALD and maintaining uniform thin film growth.  

- Q: *How does energy transfer between Eu³⁺ and AF 647 enable FRET emission?* [figure 15](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_15.jpg)

  A (paragraph): Eu³⁺ ions absorb excitation light near 400 nm and become electronically excited. Instead of emitting directly, Eu³⁺ transfers energy non-radiatively to nearby AF 647 molecules via dipole–dipole interactions. AF 647 then emits at ~660 nm, shifting the emission to a different spectral region and enabling FRET-based bio-detection applications.

## 2. Comparative/Trend Questions
**Purpose:** Probe reasoning about experimental variables (e.g., temperature, pulse length, cycles) and their impact on outcomes (growth rate, thickness, emission intensity).  
**Typical Figures:** Growth-per-cycle plots, thickness vs cycles, publication trends, efficiency curves.  

**Examples:**
- Q: *How has the number of ALD publications changed since 2000, and when did ALD/MLD publications first appear?* [figure 1](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_1.jpg)

  A (paragraph): The number of ALD publications increased steadily after 2000, reflecting growing interest in thin film deposition techniques. Around 2010, the publication rate accelerated, signaling the field’s maturation and broader adoption in industry. ALD/MLD papers appeared after 2015 and have been gaining traction, showing that hybrid approaches are becoming an active research frontier.  

- Q: *How does growth per cycle vary with deposition temperature?* [figure 3](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_3.jpg)

  A (factoid): GPC decreases from 7.3 Å at 210 °C to 5.4 Å at 240 °C.  

- Q: *What effect does adding an upconversion layer have on solar cell current density compared to the reference cell?* [figure 14](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_14.jpg)

  A (paragraph): Adding an upconversion layer increases the short-circuit current density compared to the reference cell. This enhancement occurs because the layer converts infrared photons into visible ones, which can then be absorbed by the active layer. The improvement demonstrates the potential of rare-earth-doped layers to boost solar cell efficiency beyond the conventional absorption limits.

## 3. Structure–Property Questions
**Purpose:** Evaluate ability to connect precursor structures (ligand families, rare earth types) with film properties (thermal stability, growth rates).  
**Typical Figures:** Precursor chemical families, periodic table coverage, box plots of source temperatures.  

**Examples:**
- Q: *Which ligand families are most commonly used for Eu and Ce precursors?* [figure 4](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_4.jpg) 

  A (list): Eu – diketones, amidinates; Ce – diketones, alkoxides.  

- Q: *Which precursor ligand class exhibits the lowest median source temperature?* [figure 5](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_5.jpg)

  A (factoid): Amidinate ligands (R(amd)₃).  

- Q: *Which oxidant leads to the lowest growth per cycle for Y precursors?* [figure 6](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_6.jpg)

  A (factoid): O₂ plasma.

## 4. Application/Performance Questions
**Purpose:** Assess reasoning about device-relevant outcomes (luminescence spectra, CIE color coordinates, solar cell efficiencies).  
**Typical Figures:** Emission spectra, CIE chromaticity diagrams, device schematics with J–V curves.  

**Examples:**
- Q: *How does Tb₂O₃ doping ratio affect EL intensity in Al₂O₃:Tb₂O₃ devices?* [figure 12](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_12.jpg) 

  A (paragraph): Increasing the Tb₂O₃ doping ratio improves EL intensity up to an optimal concentration, typically around a 4:4 ratio. At lower ratios, the luminescence is weaker due to insufficient activator ions. At higher ratios, concentration quenching occurs, leading to reduced performance despite the higher dopant level.  

- Q: *How do the emission colors of ALD/MLD thin films compare to LED and incandescent lamps?* [figure 13](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_13.jpg) 

  A (paragraph): ALD/MLD films typically emit in the green region of the spectrum, similar to the output of LEDs and fluorescent lamps. This overlap suggests their potential use in solid-state lighting and display technologies. However, their emission is distinct from incandescent lamps, which have a warmer, broad-spectrum output, highlighting the unique advantages of thin-film phosphors.  

- Q: *What performance advantage is shown when emission intensity is enhanced by a plasmonic substrate?* [figure 15](example_data/1/images/figures/figure_15.jpg)

  A (paragraph): The plasmonic substrate significantly amplifies the red emission from Eu-HQA films, making the signal brighter and more detectable. This enhancement arises from localized surface plasmon resonance, which boosts the excitation and emission processes. The result is a stronger photoluminescence output, which can be particularly advantageous for bio-detection applications where sensitivity is critical.
