## Project Overview  

**Sci-ImageMiner** is an annotation project on figures from **atomic layer deposition (ALD)** and **atomic layer etching (ALE)**, situated within the broader field of materials science and engineering. Within each of these categories, the data is further organized into the sub-categories **experimental-usecase** and **simulation-usecase**.

It aims to host gold-standard annotations for chart classification, data extraction, summarization, and question answering—providing both pilot and full-phase data to support multimodal AI research in scientific image understanding.   

### 🗂️ Directory Structure  

We have compiled the dataset for annotation in this repository, structured into clearly defined categories and sub-categories.  
The layout reflects the distinction between ALD and ALE literature, as well as between experimental and simulation studies, making it easier to navigate both the pilot and full annotation phases.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **[MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU)** → structured text, figures, formulas, and tables from PDFs. It is created by OpenDataLab as an open-source tool designed for data extraction from PDF documents, converting them into structured machine-readable formats like Markdown and JSON. MinerU can interpret the complex layout structure of research papers, including figures, tables, formulas, and text.
- **[Qwen2.5-VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL)** → multimodal LLM applied for classification, extraction, and summarization. Specifically, we used [Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct).  
  The [Prompts.md](Prompts.md) file documents the prompts used for information extraction (figure type, data, summary, and figure labels).

#### Figure type classification

We have defined a taxonomy of 40 figure types including "unknown". The full taxonomy with descriptions, parent taxonomy category, and aliases is here [figure_taxonomy.tsv](https://github.com/sciknoworg/ALD-E-ImageMiner/blob/main/figure_taxonomy.tsv). The ALD/E-ImageMiner project maintains a focus only on figures of parent taxonomy category `quantitative plot`.
